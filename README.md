### Plot Components
- Cities: The y-axis lists the ten Indian cities: Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Shimla, and Varanasi.
- PM2.5 Concentrations: The x-axis represents the PM2.5 concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).
- WHO Guideline: The vertical dashed line at 15 µg/m³ indicates the WHO recommended air quality guideline for 24-hour PM2.5 concentrations.

### Boxplot Details
#### For each city:
- Median: The central line in each box represents the median PM2.5 concentration.
- Interquartile Range (IQR): The box itself represents the interquartile range, which is the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles. This shows the middle 50% of the data.
- Whiskers: The lines extending from the box (whiskers) represent the range of the data excluding outliers, typically calculated as 1.5 times the IQR.
- Outliers: The dots beyond the whiskers represent outliers, which are data points that fall outside the whiskers.

#### Observations
- High Pollution Levels: Cities like Delhi, Kolkata, and Varanasi show significantly high PM2.5 concentrations with medians well above the WHO guideline of 15 µg/m³. Delhi, in particular, has a very high median concentration and a wide range of values, including many extreme outliers.
- Moderate Pollution Levels: Cities like Ahmedabad, Chennai, and Hyderabad also exceed the WHO guideline but to a lesser extent compared to Delhi.
- Lower Pollution Levels: Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune, and Shimla have lower PM2.5 concentrations, with some days exceeding the WHO guideline but generally maintaining lower median values.

### Conclusion
The boxplot highlights the severity of PM2.5 pollution in various Indian cities, with Delhi showing the highest levels. It visually underscores the need for stringent air quality control measures in cities where PM2.5 levels frequently exceed safe limits recommended by the WHO.
